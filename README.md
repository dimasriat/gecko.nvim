## Prerequisites

- Neovim (0.5 or newer)
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- [Plenary](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)

## Installation

You can install `gecko.nvim` using your favorite package manager.

### With [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
Plug 'dimasriat/gecko.nvim'
```

### With [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
    'dimasriat/gecko.nvim',
    requires = {
        { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' },
        { 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim' },
    }
}
```

## Usage

To start exploring cryptocurrency data directly within Neovim, you first need
to set up a keybinding for the `gecko:find_coin()`  function. This will allow
you to invoke the Gecko plugin and search for coin details with ease.

Here is a basic example of how to configure a keybinding:
```lua
local gecko = require("gecko")

-- Set up a keybinding to invoke the Gecko plugin
-- This binds the function to <leader>zg in normal mode
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>zg', function()
    gecko:find_coin()
end, {desc = "Invoke Gecko to find coin details"})
```
In this configuration, pressing `<leader>zg` in normal mode will activate the
`gecko:find_coin()` function, allowing you to search and display cryptocurrency
information right within your Neovim editor.

Ensure you replace `<leader>zg` with your preferred keybinding if necessary. The
`<leader>` key is a placeholder that can be defined in Neovim to be any key you
choose, making your custom shortcuts comfortable and intuitive to use.
